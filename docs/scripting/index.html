		Lgi's scripting language is loosely based on the "C" syntax, but without a number of the
		more difficult to implement parts of the language. Support for the language is broken into
		2 parts; the compiler, which converts source code into binary byte code, and the virtual machine,
		which executes the byte code in the context of the application.
		<p/>
		None of the parts of the compiler / VM system are particularly fast or modern, and if I my
		choices again I would try harder to intergrate <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> than 
		write some weird little language.
		The compiler is recursive, and the VM is based around a big switch statement. Both quite old
		concepts.
		<p/>
		That said it does work ok, and it acheives some flexibility in the various host applications.
		It's also very small, added very little overhead to the host and also comes with direct support
		for using native Lgi types, including support for DOM tree's using the '.' operator.
		<p/>
		There is a <a href="library.html">default library</a> of methods that are normally included 
		with the VM in the host application which provide some support for string manipulation and 
		other utilities.
		<p/>
		The main applications that host Lgi's scripting language are 
		<a href="http://www.memecode.com/image.php">i.Mage</a> (for drawing procedural images) and
		<a href="http://www.memecode.com/scribe.php">i.Scribe</a> (for filters, custom menu commands and
		utils/tools).
